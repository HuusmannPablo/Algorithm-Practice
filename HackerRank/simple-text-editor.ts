// Implement a simple text editor. 
// The editor initially contains an empty string, S. 
// Perform Q operations of the following 4 types:

// 1. append(W) - Append string W to the end of S.
// 2. delete(k) - Delete the last k characters of S.
// 3. print(k) - Print the kth character of S.
// 4. undo() - Undo the last (not previously undone) operation of type 1 or 2, reverting S to the state it was in prior to that operation.

// Input Format
// The first line contains an integer, Q, denoting the number of operations.
// Each line i of the Q subsequent lines (where 0 <= i < Q) defines an operation to be performed.
// Each operation starts with a single integer, t (where t âˆˆ {1, 2, 3, 4}), 
// denoting a type of operation as defined in the Problem Statement above.
// If the operation requires an argument, t is followed by its space-separated argument.
// For example, if t = 1 and W = 'abcd', line i will be 1 abcd.
